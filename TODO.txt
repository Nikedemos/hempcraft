From most to least pressing:

- add tile entity functionality to hemp plot
- add IHempGenetics interface, which will be used by hemp plots (as tile entity meta)
  and seeds (as NBT). Also translating between the two.
- add WateringCan functionality

- new Class Genotype
- new Class Gene
- new Class Chromosome
- new Class Pair
- new Class GeneInteractionTable
  
IHempGenetics interface
- boolean gender
- String id (randomly generated)
- Genome genome:

Each gene is a byte, encoded in nucleotide base 4. (A = 0, C = 1, G = 2, T = 3)
A genotype contains two copies of a gene, one from mother,
and one from the father. So we deal with chromosome pairs.

To take the value of a gene, modulo it by 2, and cast it to boolean.
To see which value will be the chosen value in the end, take the sum of the
squares of the un-moduled values and modulo by 4. The resulting int will tell us if:
- the first gene is dominant, the second gene is recessive
- the second gene is dominant, the first gene is recessive
- the genes are co-dominant (average of the two, rounded, is taken)
- the genes are clashing, causing a defect - value 0 - to be encoded in the 



- vegetative growth speed (4 genes, NUTID)
- female flowering speed (2 genes, mNUTID) 

tolerances:
 - temperature A and temperature B (the smaller one will define minimum, the bigger one - maximum)
